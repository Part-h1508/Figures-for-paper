These are the final figure which are most probbly making it into the paper
i desgined the flow first and stuck with it with some changes along the way.

the flow started from LBO defining the time series then we move towards LBO
then after LBO we move to TAI defining the time series and then show TAI in action

the flow was as follows:

* **Figure 1: Time Series Evolution** – Shows the transition from a stable signal to a signal with large-amplitude "dips" or precursors.
* **Figure 2: Frequency Spectrum (PSD)** – Shows a broad, low-frequency "rumble" as the flame becomes unstable.
* **Figure 3: LBO Precursor Duration ($\Theta$)** – Quantifies the total time spent in a "dying" state using the $0.72 \times \text{mean}$ threshold.
* **Figure 4: Cumulative Energy** – Shows how energy is distributed across a wide range of frequencies rather than a single peak.
* **Figure 5: Autocorrelation** – Demonstrates the "loss of memory"; the correlation crashes to zero instantly near LBO.
* **Figure 6: Phase Space Dynamics** – A 2D "blob" that expands but stays filled, representing the stochastic/random nature of LBO.
* **Figure 7.1: NRMS vs $\Phi/\Phi_{LBO}$** – A statistical marker showing the intensity spike as blowout approaches.
* **Figure 7.2: PDF Evolution** – Shows the probability distribution widening and deviating from a Gaussian reference.
* **Figure 7.3: Final $\Theta$ Summary** – The cumulative duration plotted against the normalized equivalence ratio to summarize LBO prediction.

* **Figure 8: TAI Time Series Evolution** – Shows the growth of amplitude from a tiny ripple to a high-amplitude sine wave (Limit Cycle).
* **Figure 9: Spectral Evolution (PSD)** – Identifies the exact acoustic frequency where the "Sharp Peak" of instability occurs.
* **Figure 10: TAI Precursor Duration ($\Theta$)** – Uses the $3\sigma$ threshold of the stable case to detect the onset of intermittency.
* **Figure 11: Phase Space Dynamics** – Shows the transition from a "blob" to a hollow "Donut" (Limit Cycle Attractor).
* **Figure 12: Autocorrelation Persistence** – Proves the system is periodic; the sine wave oscillation in the correlation does not decay.
* **Figure 13: PDF (Bimodal Transition)** – Shows the statistical shift from a Gaussian bell curve to a "two-humped" bimodal distribution.
